# SLSsatelliteConstellation
This repository involves an exposition of the System-Level-Synthesis technique pioneered by folks from Caltech and its application to a Satellite Constellation system. This repository requires you to have the SLS toolbox installed, which can be downloaded here: http://slswiki.cms.caltech.edu/index.php/SLS_Toolbox <br/>

You can also find the writeup for the project which will be a great starting point to understand SLS and an interesting application of the method.
